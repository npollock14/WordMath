# Word Math

This demonstration allows you to explore relationships between words using vector embeddings! You can apply math operations (+ and -) on the semantic meaning of words.

All embeddings are generated using ada-002 model from openai.

## Examples

- king - man + woman = queen
- japan - sushi + pizza = italy
